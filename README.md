# YouTube Screen

There is a serious flaw in YouTube.  
You can't just listen to videos in background.  
You switch to another tab or app... and audio stops.  
You turn your screen off to save battery... and audio stops.  

This app thinks it can help your screen and battery a little.  
It needs ["Draw over other apps"](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW) permission.  
That permission allows to make floating button.  
Click that button to color your screen black and reduce brightness.  
YouTube audio should still play ([Please fill in issue if it doesn't](https://github.com/turuslan/android-youtube-screen/issues/new)).  
Click anywhere to return everything to normal.  
You can drag button around.  
Hold that button down for exit button to appear.  

This app doesn't help with switching tabs and apps.  
This app assumes that [OLED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED) screens use less power for black color.  

# NewPipe
